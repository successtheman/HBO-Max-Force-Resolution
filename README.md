# HBO Max â€¢ Force Resolution
Brings the ability to manually choose resolutions on the HBO Max player. You can force whatever resolution you want, whether it's 1080p or 360p.

Seems to work better to enforce higher quality than enforcing lower quality as quality kept going higher than specified when putting the lowest quality (Not sure if this 100% works either, but it seems to help)

DISCLAIMER: I am not really qualified to maintain this, I just made some minor changes to correct the name on the popup, no updates/support are guaranteed
